#  Pulsara - Taylor Carr: Take Home Project

## Description
The purpose of this application is to provide a scrollable image view to the user. The user then has the option to select any image and view additional details

## Info
Things to know: 
1. the target iOS version for this build is 17.5

## Future Updates
1. I ran out of time, but in the future I would like to add the ability to download the image to the user's device
2. I did not use the given imageTapped() func. I was not entirely sure how to get the data back to the main view so I went a different direction. If given more time, I would find a solution to utilize imageTapped()

## Conclusion
Thank you for your time and this opportunity. I really enjoyed the project. Please let me know if you have any questions or run into any issues
